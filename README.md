# Pierian Games Database System Management and Transactions
This project focuses on creating a database management system for the Pierian Games. Here are the key aspects:

-Database Creation:Designing and creating tables in PostgreSQL to store information about events, spectators, and tickets for the Pierian Games.

-Transactions of Interest:Handling transactions such as inserting, deleting, and querying data related to events, spectators, and tickets. These transactions are fundamental  operations for managing the Pierian Games data.

-Python Application: Developing a Python application using the psycopg2 interface to interact with the PostgreSQL database. This application processes Transactions of Interest, simulating the input queue by reading data from a text file and generating results sent to an output queue.

## **Background**
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive database management system for the Pierian Games. This system, coupled with a Python application utilizing the psycopg2 interface, addresses the complexities of event management and ticketing, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and real-time accessibility of information.

This project serves as a simplified yet practical exercise, offering insights into database management, transaction handling, and application development. It draws inspiration from real-world scenarios, providing a hands-on experience for understanding the complexities of managing large-scale sports events.

In conclusion, the Pierian Games Database Management System and Python application aim to provide an effective solution for organizing and orchestrating the logistics of the Pierian Games, offering both educational value and real-world applicability.
